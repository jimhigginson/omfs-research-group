I am an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Trainee undertaking a PhD at the Institute of Head and Neck Studies within the Institute of Cancer and Genomic Science at the University of Birmingham. Currently I am funded by CRUK as a Clinical Doctoral Fellow, with an honorary fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons of England. I previously held a Research Fellowship from the Birmingham Institute of Translational Medicine, in addition to research grants from BAOMS and BAHNO. 

My research is focused on a liquid biopsy in head and neck cancer as a means to provide novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers â€“ investigating both circulating tumour DNA and circulating tumour cells. Furthermore, I am passionate about inspiring academia in maxillofacial surgery, developing educational resources and an improved accessible pathway for maxillofacial surgery trainees to undertake research projects and formal academic training.
