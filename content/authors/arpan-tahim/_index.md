I am an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery trainee based in London and have just returned from a three year out-of-programme research period. I’m in the final stages of my doctoral research at the UCL institute of Education. I’ve been investigating how learning occurs through workplace assessment amongst surgical trainees, which has been supported by grants from the Faculty of Surgical Trainers, BAOMS and ASiT. Prior to this, during my Master’s I studied how professional identity developed in dually qualified trainees. It’s been a hugely interesting experience working in this research space, which is perhaps less common and less familiar to the surgical research community

ny interest in medical education has grown slowly over the last 10 years and has led me to the world of qualitative research and methodologies. They’ve offered me broader and different insights into the how surgical education might be delivered in the future, My particular interests are video ethnography, sociocultural learning theory and multimodal social semiotics. I’m passionate about helping junior trainees to develop their clinical and research skills so am delighted to be involved with this new and enthusiastic team.
