I am currently an ST1 on the run-through training program for maxillofacial surgery in the East of England. I have always been interested in research but training in the Liverpool maxillofacial unit and Cambridge medical school confirmed that I wish to be an academic surgeon. I have an interest in head & neck surgery and reconstruction. I am currently a visiting researcher at the Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge - I am using this time to explore my different research interests (genomics, immunobiology and regenerative medicine) with a view to finding the right project, place and supervisor for my PhD. I have also put together a team in Cambridge with the view of carrying out a clinical trial in 2021. 

What I have learnt is that research requires a supportive environment. Science is a whole new world so don’t be put off if you feel like a fish out of water in the beginning. Senior academics are keen to support an enthusiastic junior so my advice will be to approach local researchers. I arranged for multiple lab visits during my second degree and I am still working out the best science project for me. With regards to the clinical trial - I found an area of equipoise that I felt could be answered with a simple trial that didn’t require large funding applications. I discussed the idea with a consultant and the hospital research department and they agreed it was an achievable project. I then put together a team of local trainees and medical students and we are currently working through all the required steps to set up and run a trial. All the information and support you need can be found on [this website](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/)
