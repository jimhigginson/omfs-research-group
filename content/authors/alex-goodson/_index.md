Alex completed his specialist training in 2020 in Wales and now works at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust as a post-CCT fellow in Head and Neck Oncology and Microvascular Reconstruction. He is coming to the end of his PhD at the University of South Wales on Additively Manufactured Cranio-Maxillofacial Implants in Future Healthcare, with a special focus on mandibular reconstruction. He has authored over thirty peer-reviewed publications and is a reviewer for a leading Maxillofacial journal. 

His research interests include virtual surgical planning and patient specific implants, microvascular surgery and free-tissue reconstruction, facial palsy and surgical education.  His postgraduate research is industry and government-funded.  This has given him a direct insight into how clinicians can collaborate with industry and academic institutions to set up meaningful, real-world clinical studies in already overstretched, busy clinical environments that can influence the future development of patient specific implants.  He has direct experience of surgical device development and patent applications within both the UK and internationally.

Outside of work, he spends as much time as he can with his young family. He enjoys drumming and performing with bands, fishing, skiing and other outbound pursuits.  A previously keen amateur rugby player, he now supports the Harlequins and England rugby, alongside a pint of pale ale.
