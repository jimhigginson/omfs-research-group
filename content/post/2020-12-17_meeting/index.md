Aim is to build a core of academics in the various areas of OMFS who can provide a community for meaningful support, critical feedback and direct advice. We should also be aware of the opportunities to promote our specialty by supporting, engaging and encouraging younger aspiring OMFS academics, and by developing an online presence that publicizes our varied, exciting and successful researchers. It was noted that the few people on the call represented widely varying research interests and goals, which is a real strength.

The group agreed that simply starting is the way to go, to build a sense of how it will work. The generally expressed feeling was that at this stage, we should maintain independence from BAOMS in order to ensure the group is first and foremost serving the needs of its members.

There was no real consensus on the best name to adopt permanently. All agreed that the name should not become a distraction and so no decision was taken, but there was acknowledgement of the eventual need for ‘brand recognition’. Further discussion can take place on WhatsApp.

# Actions
- We will meet in two months planning, having set up a website (JH and JD to coordinate) and twitter account. 
- To start the website out with some content, and to demonstrate to interested people what the potential routes and opportunities of academia are, we ask everyone who wants to be involved if they would please write a three paragraph summary of their academic career so far. It will go on the website, and should be in the ‘past, present, future’ format of what training you’ve done, what you’re currently doing research-wise,
