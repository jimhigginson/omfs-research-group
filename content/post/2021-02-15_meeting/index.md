# Meeting Minutes

SB started discussion within group about name of association 

Group agreed we should keep the ‘oral’ in ‘oral and maxillofacial’. Maintains appeal to the specialty.

AC raised valid point that if we are looking for funding from bodies such as FDS then this is very important. Group agreed.

Discussion moved to the possibility of a cryptic name. While the group liked the idea, it was deemed difficult to find one name that would satisfy everyone. Point raised that these types of cryptic names are often associated with larger associations and we want to maintain our autonomy.

AT had idea of ‘SMAS’ as an acronym. Idea well received by group. ‘Society of Maxillofacial Academic Surgeons’. 

To keep the ‘oral’ within the name, group decided to endorse name: ‘Society of Oral & Maxillofacial Academic Surgeons’ but keeping the word ‘oral’ silent in acronym.

AG raised point of adding ‘UK’ on end of name, to give gravitas and status and a clear description of our geographical remit. Idea well received by group.

Group name agreed by all present as: ‘SMAS-UK: Society of Oral & Maxillofacial Academic Surgeons’

JH presented idea of creating a trainee research course, with assistance of dual-qualified trainee Emma Whates. 

JH outlined course content. Discussion within group as to how to pitch the level of education.

JD keen to keep things simple and signposted to useful online resources.

AT made point that it is more about brand identity of the group and creating a role model for aspiring OMFS academics. Group agreed. 

JD – presented project on virtual surgery. Creating a virtual surgical learning environment for surgeons in developing nations. Several questions raised during group discussion.

Agreed that association website would be a good place to post ideas for research projects but also recruit higher degree students/trainees. 

Point raised by JH that website in its current form is for static information. We can post up projects, etc, but no forum facility as of yet. This would require additional investment. 


# Plan of action:
- JH to upload content onto website
- JH to continue work on trainee teaching resource 
- SB to develop logo.
- Group agreed to meet again in around 2 months time
- All members to send bio to JH for website
- Group members to consider making video blogs for website about their journey during funding process
