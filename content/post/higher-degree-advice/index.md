In this series of blog posts, we will provide advice for trainees and early career researchers who are considering applying for a higher degree (PhD/MD) with a view to a potential career in academia. Of course, all of our focus will be on trainees in oral and maxillofacial surgery, with dual medical and dental qualifications, and all the baggage that comes along with that!

We will cover how to find, choose and plan a higher degree, including providing insight into the perils and pitfalls of institutions, projects and supervisors.

We will also provide what we feel is valuable, hard-to-find insight into applying for and securing funding for your salary during your time out in research. This process, understandably, is lengthy, difficult and competitive. Within the group we have a great deal of experience of this process and hope that through these pages you can be spared some of the pain we felt!

For further advice, please contact the authors, or send a message to the website admin.
