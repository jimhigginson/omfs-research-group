In this page we'll try to keep an up-to-date list of all the various places you can go to for funding for your project. If any of the links are broken, please feel free to get in contact to let us know. Likewise, if you find a suitable source of funding that isn't on this list, tell us so we can add it!

Bear in mind that all funders will have their own goals, motivations, and amounts of money available. Read through the calls carefully before applying to avoid wasting large amounts of time. There's little more heartbreaking than preparing a superb application for covering your salary, only to find that your intended funder won't cover salary costs.

# Fellowships

These are funding calls aimed at funding a particular *person* to complete a project. The exact nature of the project is usually secondary (though how well the project is prepared will have a huge influence on the likelihood of them wanting to fund you!)

## One year fellowships

- RCS Eng
- RCS Edin/Glas

## Three year doctoral fellowships

- [NIHR Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/academy-programmes/fellowship-programme.htm) A good fit for projects with a significant clinical/translational element.
- [MRC Clinical Research Training Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/mrc-clinical-research-training-fellowships/) A good fit for projects that tend more towards basic science.
- [CRUK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers) The CRUK work slightly differently, in that you can't apply to them centrally for an open-competition fellowship. Instead, they allocate funding to various research institutions for fellowships, and then those institutions decide how the fellowships are applied for. If in doubt, drop them an email.
- [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/clinical-phd-programmes) Like CRUK, the Wellcome Trust have historically offered funding to institutions for them to allocate internally. Though unlike CRUK, they tend not to fund cancer projects. As of today (15th Feb 2021), the Wellcome trust say they are changing how they fund clinical PhDs, with details promised in summer 2021. Keep your eyes peeled!
