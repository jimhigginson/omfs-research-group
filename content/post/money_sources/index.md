In this page we'll try to keep an up-to-date list of all the various places you can go to for funding for your project. If any of the links are broken, please feel free to get in contact to let us know. Likewise, if you find a suitable source of funding that isn't on this list, tell us so we can add it!

Bear in mind that all funders will have their own goals, motivations, and amounts of money available. Read through the calls carefully before applying to avoid wasting large amounts of time. There's little more heartbreaking than preparing a superb application for covering your salary, only to find that your intended funder won't cover salary costs.

# Fellowships

These are funding calls aimed at funding a particular *person* to complete a project. The exact nature of the project is usually secondary (though how well the project is prepared will have a huge influence on the likelihood of them wanting to fund you!)

## One year fellowships

- RCS Eng
- RCS Edin/Glas

## Three year doctoral fellowships

- NIHR
- MRC
- CRUK
- Wellcome
