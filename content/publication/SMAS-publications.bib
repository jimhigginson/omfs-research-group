  abstract = {Background: Recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (rOSCC) after primary treatment is associated with poor survival outcomes. Salvage treatment with further surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy has high morbidity, making patient selection crucial. However, in the recurrence setting, reliable stratification data are scarce. Decision-making in this context is consequently complex. We investigated factors influencing overall survival after rOSCC. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients with rOSCC (n = 83) at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK between 2006 and 2016. Associations with overall survival were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify important clinical prognostic indicators. Results: Overall survival at 1 year was 32.5\% and at 5 years was 18.1\% after a median follow-up of 7.4 months. Multivariate analysis identified four independent predictors of overall survival following rOSCC: size of primary tumour (HR 2.077; 95\% CI 1.034-4.172), extent of recurrent disease (HR 3.286; 95\% CI 1.545-6.991), history of moderate alcohol consumption (HR 0.351; 95\% CI 0.162-0.763), and close or positive margins at primary resection (HR 1.955; 95\% CI 1.063-3.595). Conclusions: We identified four key factors that help prognostication and risk stratification of rOSCC. Given the high morbidity associated with salvage treatment, we recommend that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and the patient weigh these factors carefully when considering further treatment. Further investigation of the biology underlying these oncophenotypes may contribute to better patient stratification.},

  abstract = {Objective: It has been suggested that the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor microenvironment is associated with a better prognosis in different types of cancer. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the prognostic role of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched up to September 2020. This study was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Risk ratios from individual studies were displayed in forest plots and the pooled hazard ratios (HR) of death and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were calculated according to random-effects models. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed through the Newcastle\textendash Ottawa scale. Results: 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies conducted on HNSCC subsites combined reported a significant reduction in the risk of death for both high CD4+ (HR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.65-0.93) and high CD8+ TILs (HR: 0.64; 95\% CI: 0.47\textendash 0.88). High CD4+ TILs were associated with significantly better overall survival among oropharyngeal HNSCC (HR: 0.52; 95\% CI: 0.31\textendash 0.89), as well as high CD8+ TILS in Human papillomavirus -ve and +ve cancers (HR: 0.39; 95\% CI: 0.16\textendash 0.93 and HR: 0.40; 95\% CI 0.21\textendash 0.76 respectively). CD8+ TILs were also associated with improved survival in hypopharyngeal cancers (HR = 0.43 CI: 0.30\textendash 0.63). No significant association emerged for patients with cancer of the oral cavity or larynx. Conclusions: The findings from this meta-analysis demonstrate the prognostic significance of CD8+ and CD4+ TILs in HNSCC and variation in tumor subsite warrants further focused investigation. We highlight how TILs may serve as predictive biomarkers to risk stratify patients into treatment groups, with applications in immune-checkpoint inhibitors notable areas for further research.},

  abstract = {Unilateral condylar hyperplasia is a rare disease that causes facial asymmetry as a result of excessive vertical or horizontal growth, or both, of the mandibular condyle. Investigation should address the patient's concerns, and establish whether the disease is active with the use of single positron emission tomography (PET). Proportional reduction of the condyle arrests active disease and restores mandibular height, and any residual asymmetry can be corrected according to conventional orthognathic principles. We recommend the use of 3-dimensional virtual planning for such complex movements. The rarity of the disease means that, to our knowledge, high-quality evidence is lacking and further research is needed.},

  abstract = {Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions (TFILs) of the head and neck are rare and benign but locally aggressive lesions. The etiology and pathogenesis of these lesions are unknown. Medical management is regarded the first line of treatment. Surgical management has been rarely reported for head and neck lesions. A 51-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of left facial swelling and pain that subsequently developed into progressive inframalar hollowing and asymmetry. Biopsies confirmed tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion of the maxilla. Initial treatment with high-dose steroids led to temporary partial involution; however, symptoms progressed. Cyclophosphamide and then rituximab were commenced, with minimal response. Imaging showed progression toward the infratemporal fossa. The patient subsequently underwent a resection and microvascular free flap reconstruction This patient had a successful surgical outcome and resolution of serum inflammatory markers with no evidence of recurrence after 18month follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to ensure a pragmatic patient-specific management plan is developed. Surgical resection and reconstruction can be successful in these lesions and should be considered if medical therapy has failed.},

  abstract = {Secondary care Trusts nationwide are continuing to fail the 18-week referral to treatment (RTT) target despite several initiatives to improve theatre efficiency (2018 NHS England review). A limitation of wasted theatre productivity is required to alleviate pressures on waiting lists. Productivity, which is a measure of treatment time as a proportion of available/allocated time, takes into consideration variations in operator performance, early (non-funded) theatre starts, and over-run, and its analysis enables the determination of theatre downtime and lost theatre capacity. We monitored productivity over a 12-week period and performed downtime analysis as reported in the NHS Improvement national audit (NHSI). Results showed a marked but predictable variation in productivity connected to turnaround and session list scheduling. Productivity and booking efficiency correlated uniformly (Pearson's r = 0.82). Theatre downtime was analysed with respect to three components defined in the NHSI national audit: late starts, early finish, and turnaround. We found that lost theatre time was predominantly due to early finishes; late starts were infrequent. Transport time correlated unfavourably with productivity (Pearson's r = -0.29, p = 0.037) and over-run (r = 0.44), and prolonged transport times were shorter when surgery was performed in a dedicated day surgery unit. Calculating the mean transport times for lists with high compared with low productivity helped us set a benchmark for patient transport times for future audit.},
