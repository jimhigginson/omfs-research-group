abstract: "Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions (TFILs) of the head and neck are rare and benign but locally aggressive lesions. The etiology and pathogenesis of these lesions are unknown. Medical management is regarded the first line of treatment. Surgical management has been rarely reported for head and neck lesions. A 51-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of left facial swelling and pain that subsequently developed into progressive inframalar hollowing and asymmetry. Biopsies confirmed tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion of the maxilla. Initial treatment with high-dose steroids led to temporary partial involution; however, symptoms progressed. Cyclophosphamide and then rituximab were commenced, with minimal response. Imaging showed progression toward the infratemporal fossa. The patient subsequently underwent a resection and microvascular free flap reconstruction This patient had a successful surgical outcome and resolution of serum inflammatory markers with no evidence of recurrence after 18month follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to ensure a pragmatic patient-specific management plan is developed. Surgical resection and reconstruction can be successful in these lesions and should be considered if medical therapy has failed."
